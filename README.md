# Advanced Data Analysis and Time Series Forecasting

This project, conducted as part of the Data Mining course at the University of Wollongong in Dubai, focuses on the comprehensive exploration of sales data. The primary objective was to understand underlying patterns such as trends, seasonality, and structural breaks, leading to accurate predictive modeling.

## Project Overview

The analysis covered multiple aspects of the dataset, delving into both general and product-specific behaviors. Techniques such as ARIMA, Vector Autoregression (VAR), change point analysis, and smoothing were employed to forecast sales and provide actionable insights.

## Key Components

**Data Preparation**  
- Combined five different datasets and sorted them based on date to ensure a cohesive and chronological dataset for analysis.  
- Detailed steps taken to clean and preprocess the data for accurate analysis and forecasting.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- Initial exploration of the dataset, including visualizations and statistical summaries to uncover key patterns.

**Time Series Decomposition**  
- Decomposition of the time series data into trend, seasonality, and residual components for in-depth analysis.

**Product Family Analysis**  
- In-depth analysis of specific product families such as Poultry, Frozen Foods, Liquor, Prepared Foods, and Meats.  
- Comparison across product families to identify those with the strongest trends, seasonality, and randomness.

**Impact of Promotions and External Events**  
- Investigation into the influence of promotional activities on sales across different product families.  
- Analysis of significant external events, such as earthquakes, using structural break and change point analysis.

**Time Series Forecasting**  
- Time series forecasting performed using ARIMA to predict future sales trends.  
- Application of Vector Autoregression (VAR) for multivariate forecasting, capturing interdependencies between product families.

**Model Diagnostics and Validation**  
- Examination of residuals from the ARIMA model to validate assumptions and assess model accuracy.  
- Application of the Dickey-Fuller Test to ensure the stationarity of the time series data.

**Advanced Analysis Techniques**  
- Use of smoothing techniques to understand long-term trends.  
- Visualization of forecast uncertainty using fancharts.

**Conclusions and Insights**  
- Summarization of findings from the comparative analysis of product families and the impact of various factors on sales patterns.  
- Final insights drawn from the forecasting models and their implications for business strategy.
